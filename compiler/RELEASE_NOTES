The following are the changes in the 12.1.3 release of the Snapdragon LLVM
ARM C/C++ Toolchain over the 12.1.3 release.

1. Support for PAC-RET/BTI with B-key
2. Support for armv7em target triple with baremetal options 

The following are the changes in the 12.1.2 release of the Snapdragon LLVM
ARM C/C++ Toolchain over the 12.1.1 release.

1. Fixed MUSL libc initialization for baremetal target to not depend on any OS environment info
2. Added support for large allocation sizes for MUSL Libc malloc for baremetal environment
3. Support GNU_RELRO with PHDRS 

The following are the changes in the 12.1.1 release of the Snapdragon LLVM
ARM C/C++ Toolchain over the 12.1 release.

1. Runtime and C library support for armv8r targets (32 and 64-bit)
2. Fix corner case for PIC relocation in aarch64
3. Support large atomic structure as function parameter

This is the release of Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version
12.1. This is a minor revision update for the 12.0 release that went out in
November 2020. This is a cross toolchain built to run on x86 64-bit Ubuntu
Linux (versions 14.04 and later) and Windows platform (Windows 7 64-bit and
later). The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler will generate code for ARM and X86
targets and will not generate code for any of the other targets supported by
the llvm.org compiler.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM 12.1 toolchain includes all changes in the
llvm.org 12.0 release branch, and proprietary features and optimizations
that are not available in the llvm.org 12.0 branch.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler uses the integrated assembler for assembling
and includes a full featured proprietary linker (QC Linker) for linking.

The following link contains all the new features in the llvm.org 11.0 release.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM 12.1 toolchain contains all the above features,
including the following key features compared to the Snapdragon LLVM ARM 12.0
toolchain.

Following are the main features
1. ARMv9 C code pointer authentication support
2. Support for generating SVE loop predication
3. Support for ARMv8.2 crypto extension intrinsics
4. MUSL C library for use with pointer authentication
5. Support for preserving unused variables in bare metal images
